# CNN and Denoising
An application with CNN to remove different types of noise from images.

A very nice and quick application of how we can train a CNN to learn the different types of noise and remove them from the images. 

On this study, I'm using the MNIST dataset, and generating the noise myself. I'm applying Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Poisson and Speckle noise to the images.
